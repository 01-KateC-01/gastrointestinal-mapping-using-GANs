# Objective 1: Image Classifier for Fashion MNIST 

---
> <p align = "justify">This objective aims to provide fundamental knoweledge on TensorFlow and Colab which are the prominent tools to be used in the project. In addition, should all cores tasks be completed, an image classifier will be used to complete a more detailed version of the AI system to be created. 
> Thus, in this notebook an image classifier for the Fashion MNIST Dataset is implemented.

Two different methods were implemented to develop a through methodology when testing a neural network: 

1- conventional neural network

2- convolutional neural network
